# ascii_terraria
A simple Terraria like game using Windows console as output. Old project.

Made a while ago and containing some problems, some rushed and unfinished features. 

Press 'O' while on grass to see some magic happen.
## Compiling
Just compile main.cpp. All others .cpp files are (mistakenly, but I knew no better) included.
